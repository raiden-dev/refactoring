### Instrumenter

Command: `js-instrument`  
Basic usage: `js-instrument -o /path/to/output.js -c /path/to/inst.js input.js`  

Instrumenter tool takes input file with your code, instruments it with client instructions and places output to path specified by `-o` or `--output` option.  

You need to include client file in your project as well to handle added instructions. To use default instrumenter client pass the option `-c` or `--client` with path where to place client's file. Note that the client script should be included before the instrumented script on the page.  

When using default client it will export `window.inst` object. Use `window.inst.result()` method to see current statistics.
